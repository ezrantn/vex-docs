# Overview

Text processing can be a tough challenge for developers, but that's where Vex steps in! Vex is a powerful combination of a command-line interface (CLI) and a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to make text manipulation and analysis simpler and more efficient. With Vex, handling text in your projects becomes easier and more intuitive.

Inspired by both academic research and practical needs, Vex bridges the gap between traditional tools like `awk` and `sed` and the demands of modern text processing. While these UNIX classics have been reliable for decades, Vex brings a fresh approach with unique features tailored to today's needs. It's not here to replace them but to offer a modern alternative.
