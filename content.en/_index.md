# Overview

In the ever-changing world of software development, dealing with text can be a real pain for developers. That’s where Vex comes to the rescue! It’s a cool blend of a command-line interface (CLI) and a domain-specific language (DSL) made just for text manipulation and analysis. With Vex, we get a fresh and easier way to handle all that text in our projects!

Vex was born from a mix of academic research and real-world needs. While classic tools like `awk` and `sed` have been solid go-tos in the UNIX world for ages, the increasing complexity of modern text processing has opened the door for new solutions. Vex isn’t here to replace those old-timers; instead, it offers a modern alternative with its own cool benefits.
